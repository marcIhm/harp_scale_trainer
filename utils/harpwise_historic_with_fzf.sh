#  Source this script for a bash-function hwh ("hwh" stands for harpwise historic) to invoke
#  fzf ("fuzzy finder") on the invocation-files of harpwise. fzf needs to be installed as a
#  prerequisite.
#
#  The variable HARPWISE_COMMAND can be used to specify a command to invoke harpwise; the
#  default is 'harpwise' but can be changed to something different, e.g. an alias,
#  e.g. 'hw', if you prefer.
#
#  Then invoke e.g. 'hwh' or 'hwh play' and continue completion by typing; finish with
#  RETURN. The last match will be your new commandline and can be edited further; ty√ºe
#  RETURN again to execute it
#

# Note for development: This needs to run under bash as well as zsh; so only the common
# subset of features is available
