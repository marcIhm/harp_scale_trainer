Play each lick as long as it is displayed, e.g. play the first lick four times, then the second lick two times, etc. Note, that always the current, matching chord (scale) is highlighted in the harmonica-chart to hint on holes for improvisation.

    // The array "timestamps_to_actions" is the central data structure of this file.
    // it is an array, where each element has one of these forms:
    //
    //   [timestamp, "message", message, secs_to_show]
    //   [timestamp, "loop-start", message, secs_to_show] 
    //   [timestamp, "keys", key1, key2, ... ]
    //
    // where "loop-start" is just like "message" but also marks the entrypoint
    // for the second and any further iterations, so that action before "loop-start"
    // are only executed once.
    //
    // Writing a new json file for a new backing track is actually quite doable.
    // For this you need to get the timestamps (in seconds) of chord-changes, which
    // are easy to figure out with audacity and its text-label-feature.

    // timestamps-to-actions will be repeated forever; this assumes that the
    // chord-structure of your song is regular and repeats too.

//  After some practice with the backing-track 12bar.mp3 you may want to try one
//  of your own backing-track (e.g. one, that can be found on youtube).
//  For this you will need to prepare another json-file and put in the
//  filename of your new backing-track. In addition you will need to adjust timestamps.
//
//  Admittedly, preparing those timestamps needs some technical work; however, your ear and
//  good tools make this a matter of minutes. Try e.g. audacity and its feature of creating
//  and exporting text-markers.
//
//  As an easier (but maybe less accurate) method, you may try 'harpwise jam play' and
//  press 't' as appropriate.
